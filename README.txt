This is a website for posting assignments that I will use for teaching girls to code.  I mentor girls through online coding competitions,
and it would be helpful to have one site to post all of the information I use for different teams.  Some of the teams I mentor come from 
other countries and speak English as a second language, so I have also included a translation dropdown to use on the whole site.

Students and other mentors can create an account to log in with, and mentors can create and delete posts.  Only the creator of a post can edit or delete it.
There is also a change password functionality if anyone forgets their password.
